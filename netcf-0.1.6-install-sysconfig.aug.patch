 netcf-0.1.6-handle-quoted-entries.patch, intended to fix rhbz#613886,
modified Makefile.am to install the newly added file
/usr/share/netcf/data/lenses/sysconfig.aug. This didn't work for RHEL.

The problem is that on an upstream build autogen gets run, which
creates Makefile.in, which is then used by configure to generate
Makefile. On a RHEL build, autogen is not called, so changes to
Makefile.am don't show up in Makefile; instead we must modify
Makefile.in by hand. This patch simply replicates the Makefile.am
change in Makefile.in.

Since this is not necessary upstream, there is no upstream equivalent
patch to reference.
